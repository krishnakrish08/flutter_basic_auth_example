# flutter_basic_auth_example

A Basic Auth Flutter project.

## Instructions: 
Replace your_redirect_uri_scheme and your_redirect_uri_host with the scheme and host of your redirect URI. 
For example, if your redirect URI is com.example.app:/oauthredirect, 
then your_redirect_uri_scheme would be com.example.app and your_redirect_uri_host would be oauthredirect.


## Web Configuration
For web, you need to configure your OAuth provider to recognize your web app's URL as a valid redirect URI. The steps to do this vary depending on the OAuth provider you are using. Below are general steps for some popular providers:

## Google
Go to Google Cloud Console: Navigate to the Google Cloud Console.

## Create a Project: 
If you don't have a project, create a new one.

## Enable APIs: 
Go to the "APIs & Services" section and enable the "OAuth 2.0" API.

## Create OAuth Credentials:

Go to "Credentials" and click "Create Credentials".
Choose "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs".
Set the application type to "Web application".

Add your web app's URL to the "Authorized redirect URIs" field. For example, https://yourapp.com/auth/callback.
Save and Use Credentials: Save the client ID and client secret. Use these in your Flutter app.

## Auth0
Go to Auth0 Dashboard: Navigate to the Auth0 Dashboard.

## Create an Application: 
If you don't have an application, create a new one.

## Configure Application:

Go to the "Settings" tab of your application.
Add your web app's URL to the "Allowed Callback URLs" field. For example, https://yourapp.com/auth/callback.
Save Changes: Save the changes and use the client ID and client secret in your Flutter app.

## Okta
Go to Okta Dashboard: Navigate to the Okta Dashboard.

## Create an Application: 
If you don't have an application, create a new one.

## Configure Application:

## Go to the "Applications" section and select your application.
Add your web app's URL to the "Login redirect URIs" field. For example, https://yourapp.com/auth/callback.
Save Changes: Save the changes and use the client ID and client secret in your Flutter app.

Okta and Auth0 are not part of Google Cloud Console. They are separate identity and access management platforms that provide authentication and authorization services. Let's break down what each of these services is and how they differ from Google Cloud Console.

## Okta
Okta is an enterprise-grade identity management service that provides single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and lifecycle management for users. It supports a wide range of authentication protocols, including OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML.

Use Cases: Okta is often used by enterprises to manage employee access to various applications, secure customer logins, and provide a unified identity platform.
Features: SSO, MFA, user provisioning, API access management, and more.
Website: Okta
Auth0
Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. It supports various authentication methods, including social logins (like Google, Facebook), enterprise logins (like Active Directory), and custom databases.

Use Cases: Auth0 is popular among developers for quickly adding authentication to web, mobile, and API applications.
Features: Social logins, enterprise logins, MFA, user management, and more.
Website: Auth0
Google Cloud Console
Google Cloud Console is a web-based interface for managing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources and services. It includes a wide range of tools for computing, storage, data analytics, machine learning, and more.

Use Cases: Google Cloud Console is used for managing cloud infrastructure, deploying applications, and leveraging Google's cloud services.
Features: Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and more.
Website: Google Cloud Console

## Comparison
Okta and Auth0: Both are specialized identity and access management platforms focused on providing authentication and authorization services. They are not tied to any specific cloud provider and can be used with various platforms and applications.
Google Cloud Console: A comprehensive cloud platform that includes a wide range of services beyond just identity management. Google Cloud Console does offer identity services through Firebase Authentication and Google Identity Platform, but it is not as specialized as Okta or Auth0.
When to Use Each
Use Okta if you need a robust, enterprise-grade identity management solution with extensive features for managing user access and security.
Use Auth0 if you want a flexible, developer-friendly solution to quickly add authentication and authorization to your applications.
Use Google Cloud Console if you are already using Google Cloud Platform services and need to manage cloud resources, including identity services through Firebase Authentication or Google Identity Platform.
Example Use Cases
Okta: A large enterprise wants to manage employee access to internal applications and enforce security policies.
Auth0: A startup wants to add social login options to its mobile app quickly.
Google Cloud Console: A company is deploying a web application on Google Cloud and needs to manage cloud resources and services.
